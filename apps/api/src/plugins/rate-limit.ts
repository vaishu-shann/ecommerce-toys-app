/**
 * An in-process rate limiter.

 * `API.md` applies limits at Cloudflare *and* in-process, because the app-level limit must
 * hold even if a request bypasses the edge. This is the in-process half: a fixed-window
 * counter per key, cheap and stateless beyond a `Map`.
 *
 * In-process means per-instance, which is the honest bound for a Cloud Functions
 * deployment — each instance limits its own traffic, and the edge limit is the global one.
 * A cross-instance limit would need a shared store (Firestore or Redis) on the hot path of
 * every request; that is a deliberate non-goal for v1.0, where the edge carries the global
 * ceiling and this stops a single instance being hammered.
